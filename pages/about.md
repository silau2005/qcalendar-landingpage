I'm a developer and innovator based in the heart of Hong Kong. I started my journey in software development as a project-based professional, helping clients bring their ideas to life through custom software solutions.

Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working on a variety of projects, including:

* **E-claim System:** Streamlined the claim process for a group with over 20 subsidiaries by digitizing the workflow and centralizing it across the entire organization.
* **Business Management System:** Built a specialized system to manage marketing campaign data, encompassing income, expenses, air period, PO management, and seamless integration with accounting software.
* **Hotel Room Management Add-on:** Developed a lightweight application for hospitality clients, automating data input and enhancing efficiency.
* **Mobile App & Website Development:** I've also delivered successful mobile app and website projects for various clients.

**Embracing the Future: Focusing on SaaS Development**

While I've thrived in the project-based space, I'm now focusing my efforts on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) development. This involves creating user-friendly, cloud-based applications designed to serve a wider audience. My passion lies in building scalable and impactful products.

I believe in building strong relationships and delivering solutions that exceed expectations. I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute my expertise and turn vision into reality. For any inquiries, feel free to contact me at [steven@regnum.io](mailto:steven@regnum.io).

We're a passionate team of developers and innovators based in the heart of Hong Kong. We started out as a project-based company, helping clients bring their ideas to life through custom software solutions. 

Over the years, we've had the pleasure of working on a variety of projects, including:

* **E-claim System:** Streamlined the claim process for a group with over 10 subsidiaries by digitizing the workflow and centralizing it across the entire organization.
* **Business Management System:** Built a specialized system to manage marketing campaign data, encompassing income, expenses, air period, PO management, and seamless integration with accounting software.
* **Hotel Room Management Add-on:** Developed a lightweight application for hospitality clients, automating data input and enhancing efficiency.
* **Mobile App & Website Development:** We've also delivered successful mobile app and website projects for various clients.

**Looking Ahead: Embracing the Future**

While we've thrived in the project-based space, we're excited to announce our transition towards a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. This means developing user-friendly, cloud-based applications that cater to a wider audience.

**Currently, we're still open to project inquiries.** If you have a specific software need, we'd love to hear from you and discuss how we can help. For any inquiries, feel free to contact us at [steven@regnum.io](mailto:steven@regnum.io).

We believe in building strong relationships with our clients and delivering solutions that exceed expectations. Let's turn your vision into reality!
